tuxedo
======

An improved version of the [Bouncer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bouncer) mirror
management software.

Bouncer is a Mozilla project. The new admin backend was originally written by
Frederic Wenzel (fwenzel@mozilla.com).

Getting Started
---------------
Note that this Django app does not manage its own SQL... yet. Please refer to
``sql/mirror.sql``, which is a copy of
    http://svn.mozilla.org/projects/bouncer/1.0/trunk/php/cfg/mirror.sql
at the time of writing.

LICENSE
-------

Why "tuxedo"?
-------------
In my silly mind, I chose to interpret "Bouncer" as "doorman" and subsequently
decided that its new version should be codenamed like what fancy bouncers wear:
a tuxedo.
