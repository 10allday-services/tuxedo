tuxedo
======

An admin frontend for the [Bouncer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bouncer) mirror
management software.

Why "tuxedo"?
-------------
In my silly mind, I chose to interpret "Bouncer" as "doorman" and subsequently
decided that a "frontend" to it must be called like what doormen wear:
a tuxedo.
