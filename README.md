An admin frontend for the [Bouncer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bouncer) mirror
management software.

This software was originally written by Frederic Wenzel (fwenzel@mozilla.com).

Getting Started
---------------
Note that this Django app does not manage its own SQL. Please refer to
``sql/mirror.sql``, which is a copy of
    http://svn.mozilla.org/projects/bouncer/1.0/trunk/php/cfg/mirror.sql
at the time of writing.

Why "tuxedo"?
-------------
In my silly mind, I chose to interpret "Bouncer" as "doorman" and subsequently
decided that a "frontend" to it must be called like what bouncers wear:
a tuxedo.
